## Purpose
As a user, I'd like to be able to check the weather for today to plan my accordingly as well as the next five days to plan the rest of my week.
The application consists of two dynamically generated api urls, one for getting the city and converting it to longitude and lattitude, and one for getting
the current weather and five day forecast.
